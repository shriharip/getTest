# getTest

This is a repo where I have code for testing the wonderful [Getx package](https://pub.dev/packages/get)

The lib folder has the code and we are testing some features of the GetPackage along with clear separation of the UI from logic

1. A text field with subscriptions that are listened to and the rebuild of widget
2. A dialog management from the controller.
3. Navigation using Get
4. Theme change without context
5. Translations with arugments (via string extensions using again just Get)


I highly recommend using the VS code extension [GetX snippets](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=get-snippets.get-snippets#classes)

this will significantly decrease your time to build beautiful flutter apps.

Happy flutterring!!!
